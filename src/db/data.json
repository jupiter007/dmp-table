Data was collected by completing four questionnaires: the “profile of the person with RTT” form, the “family sociodemographic profile” form, the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), and the Beach Center Family Quality of Life Scale (BCFQoLS). The PedsQL questionnaire assesses the quality of life linked to the health of children and adolescents and has 21 to 23 items that cover four dimensions: (1) physical, (2) emotional, (3) social, and (4) school. The social and school dimensions were not investigated in this study due to the characteristics of the sample and also because of the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to social isolation and suspension from school activities. Thus, only the physical and emotional dimensions of the PedsQL were considered. The BCFQoLS is a specific scale to assess the quality of life for families that have a member with a disability and consists of 25 items, divided into five domains: (1) parental care for children, (2) family interaction, (3) emotional well-being, (4) physical/material well-being, and (5) disability-related support.</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, we intend that this study serves as a subsidy for building a comprehensive care line for patients with rare genetic diseases, such as RTT, in accordance with the National Policy for Comprehensive Care for People with Rare Diseases in the Brazilian Unified Health System.</p>",

A abordagem multidisciplinar da proposta visa mobilizar e potencializar a interação entre metalurgistas, corrosionistas e engenheiros civis em prol de uma temática em comum.</p>\r\n<p>O aço e o concreto são considerados a “espinha dorsal” da infraestrutura moderna. São materiais estratégicos para a expansão e o desenvolvimento de qualquer sociedade, empregados separadamente ou em sinergia como concreto armado. A concepção do concreto armado foi um marco, já que propicia elementos estruturais com propriedades mecânicas satisfatórias à um preço competitivo. O desenvolvimento tecnológico de países com dimensões continentais e populosos depende necessariamente de infraestrutura durável e acessível, a qual é fortemente dependente de pesquisas e tecnologias em materiais cimentícios e aços. Além de extenso (8.510.295 km²) e populoso (~211 milhões de habitantes), o Brasil possui como principais atividades a construção civil e a siderurgia.</p>\r\n<p>O projeto de pesquisa é de cunho aplicado e inspirado no uso cuja relevância é internacional, porém com forte apelo nas demandas e necessidades brasileiras. Na frente de materiais cimentícios, alternativas de menor pegada de CO2 ao tradicional cimento Portland são o enfoque, tais como os cimentos curados por carbonatação, os cimentos álcali ativados, e os cimentos ternários a base de argila calcinada e calcário. Uma característica crucial de matrizes cimentícias Portland é sua capacidade de prover uma solução de poro capaz de induzir a passivação espontânea e efetiva de armaduras de aço carbono, e de mantê-las protegidas graças a cobertura de concreto, a qual assegura a vida útil projetada. Sabe-se que a solução de poro de novas matrizes cimentícias são mais corrosivas às armaduras tradicionais, sendo a passivação espontânea e efetiva do aço questionável. Portanto, na frente de armaduras inovadoras, o intuito é desenvolver aços inoxidáveis <em>lean</em> com propriedades mecânicas e eletroquímicas balanceadas a um preço competitivo, que sejam compatíveis com as matrizes cimentícias atuais mais sustentáveis. A missão é compatibilizar armaduras e matrizes cimentícias inovadoras através de um estudo holístico compreendendo diferentes ângulos: i) caracterização completa das matrizes cimentícias iniciais, e a evolução de fase, microestrutura e solução de poro ao longo da hidratação e exposição à ambientes agressivos [carbonatação e cloretos], ii) concepção, produção e caracterização de novas armaduras que sejam intermediárias entre as existentes em aço carbono e inoxidáveis, iii) capacidade intrínseca de passivação das novas armaduras em matrizes cimentícias inovadoras, iv) testes laboratoriais acelerados de durabilidade face a corrosão induzida por cloretos e carbonatação de matrizes cimentícias de menor pegada de CO2 reforçadas por armaduras inoxidáveis <em>lean</em>, e v) exposição de corpos de prova em região costeira e urbana para migração natural de cloretos e carbonatação, seguido de avaliação de desempenho.</p>\r\n<p>Buscar-se-á conciliar Ensino e Pesquisa, Ciência e Tecnologia, Inovação e Aplicação, todas interligadas, sempre com enfoque na formação e capacitação de alunos de graduação e de pós-graduação, além de transbordar o conhecimento e tecnologia para profissionais já inseridos no mercado de trabalho.</p>",

      "description": "<p>O Projeto Inicial π descrito nesta proposta dedica-se à materiais para construção civil, com o objetivo de promover progressos científicos e tecnológicos integrados com iniciativas de ensino em concretos armados inovadores que sejam duráveis, seguros, sustentáveis e acessíveis. A abordagem multidisciplinar da proposta visa mobilizar e potencializar a interação entre metalurgistas, corrosionistas e engenheiros civis em prol de uma temática em comum.</p>\r\n<p>O aço e o concreto são considerados a “espinha dorsal” da infraestrutura moderna. São materiais estratégicos para a expansão e o desenvolvimento de qualquer sociedade, empregados separadamente ou em sinergia como concreto armado. A concepção do concreto armado foi um marco, já que propicia elementos estruturais com propriedades mecânicas satisfatórias à um preço competitivo. O desenvolvimento tecnológico de países com dimensões continentais e populosos depende necessariamente de infraestrutura durável e acessível, a qual é fortemente dependente de pesquisas e tecnologias em materiais cimentícios e aços. Além de extenso (8.510.295 km²) e populoso (~211 milhões de habitantes), o Brasil possui como principais atividades a construção civil e a siderurgia.</p>\r\n<p>O projeto de pesquisa é de cunho aplicado e inspirado no uso cuja relevância é internacional, porém com forte apelo nas demandas e necessidades brasileiras. Na frente de materiais cimentícios, alternativas de menor pegada de CO2 ao tradicional cimento Portland são o enfoque, tais como os cimentos curados por carbonatação, os cimentos álcali ativados, e os cimentos ternários a base de argila calcinada e calcário. Uma característica crucial de matrizes cimentícias Portland é sua capacidade de prover uma solução de poro capaz de induzir a passivação espontânea e efetiva de armaduras de aço carbono, e de mantê-las protegidas graças a cobertura de concreto, a qual assegura a vida útil projetada. Sabe-se que a solução de poro de novas matrizes cimentícias são mais corrosivas às armaduras tradicionais, sendo a passivação espontânea e efetiva do aço questionável. Portanto, na frente de armaduras inovadoras, o intuito é desenvolver aços inoxidáveis <em>lean</em> com propriedades mecânicas e eletroquímicas balanceadas a um preço competitivo, que sejam compatíveis com as matrizes cimentícias atuais mais sustentáveis. A missão é compatibilizar armaduras e matrizes cimentícias inovadoras através de um estudo holístico compreendendo diferentes ângulos: i) caracterização completa das matrizes cimentícias iniciais, e a evolução de fase, microestrutura e solução de poro ao longo da hidratação e exposição à ambientes agressivos [carbonatação e cloretos], ii) concepção, produção e caracterização de novas armaduras que sejam intermediárias entre as existentes em aço carbono e inoxidáveis, iii) capacidade intrínseca de passivação das novas armaduras em matrizes cimentícias inovadoras, iv) testes laboratoriais acelerados de durabilidade face a corrosão induzida por cloretos e carbonatação de matrizes cimentícias de menor pegada de CO2 reforçadas por armaduras inoxidáveis <em>lean</em>, e v) exposição de corpos de prova em região costeira e urbana para migração natural de cloretos e carbonatação, seguido de avaliação de desempenho.</p>\r\n<p>Buscar-se-á conciliar Ensino e Pesquisa, Ciência e Tecnologia, Inovação e Aplicação, todas interligadas, sempre com enfoque na formação e capacitação de alunos de graduação e de pós-graduação, além de transbordar o conhecimento e tecnologia para profissionais já inseridos no mercado de trabalho.</p>",

Large datasets are therefore imperative, as well as fully automated image post-processing tools to analyze them. The development of such tools, particularly with artificial intelligence, is highly dependent on the availability of large datasets to model training and testing. We will create and share a public dataset of 4,000 multimodal clinical MRIs and CTs of patients with acute and early subacute stroke, with manual lesion segmentation, and metadata. The dataset provides high quality, large scale, human-supervised knowledge to feed artificial intelligence models and enable further development of tools to automate several tasks that currently rely on human labor, such as lesion segmentation, labeling, calculation of disease-relevant scores. It also represents a valuable training and testing resource for translational research relating lesion features to risk factors, brain functions and patients’ outcomes.</p>",

      "description": "<p>To extract meaningful and reproducible models of brain function from stroke images, for both clinical and research proposes, is a daunting task severely hindered by the great variability of lesion frequency and patterns. Large datasets are therefore imperative, as well as fully automated image post-processing tools to analyze them. The development of such tools, particularly with artificial intelligence, is highly dependent on the availability of large datasets to model training and testing. We will create and share a public dataset of 4,000 multimodal clinical MRIs and CTs of patients with acute and early subacute stroke, with manual lesion segmentation, and metadata. The dataset provides high quality, large scale, human-supervised knowledge to feed artificial intelligence models and enable further development of tools to automate several tasks that currently rely on human labor, such as lesion segmentation, labeling, calculation of disease-relevant scores. It also represents a valuable training and testing resource for translational research relating lesion features to risk factors, brain functions and patients’ outcomes.</p>",

This program researches the early life history of juvenile salmon in coastal British Columbia. Primary research objectives are determining: 1) Migration timing rates and routes; 2) Migration habitat, including physical and chemical oceanographic conditions, and availability of plankton prey; 3) The impacts of prey phenology, quantity and quality on juvenile salmon growth and condition; 4) Species and stock-specific feeding biology and competitive interactions; 5) Pathogen and parasite infection dynamics; and 6) Mortality estimates. The program targets Fraser River sockeye, and pink and chum salmon, but additionally provides information on coho, chinook, and herring through incidental capture. The field program operates between May and July during the peak of the juvenile sockeye outward migration. Purse seine and oceanographic sampling are conducted in the northern Strait of Georgia / Discovery Islands region (~ 220 km from the Fraser River mouth).</p>",

This program researches the early life history of juvenile salmon in coastal British Columbia. Primary research objectives are determining: 1) Migration timing rates and routes; 2) Migration habitat, including physical and chemical oceanographic conditions, and availability of plankton prey; 3) The impacts of prey phenology, quantity and quality on juvenile salmon growth and condition; 4) Species and stock-specific feeding biology and competitive interactions; 5) Pathogen and parasite infection dynamics; and 6) Mortality estimates. The program targets Fraser River sockeye, and pink and chum salmon, but additionally provides information on coho, chinook, and herring through incidental capture. The field program operates between May and July during the peak of the juvenile sockeye outward migration. Purse seine and oceanographic sampling are conducted in the northern Strait of Georgia / Discovery Islands region (~ 220 km from the Fraser River mouth).</p>",
